This day is considered to be a trade celebration marking the beginning of the Christmas holiday season. For several decades, Black Friday has been widely recognized as the largest shopping day of the year in the US. For most retailers, it is the busiest day of the year. According to Statista, $534 million were spent on Black Friday in 2008. In 2013, US consumers spent more than $50 billion and over 92 million people visited brick-and-mortar stores (Grannis, 2014).TThat number has since skyrocketed to $1.5 billion in 2014. \n\nBlack Friday is traditionally the day with the highest purchasing volume of the year which accounts for 30% of the annual turnover of retail stores and in some product categories such as jewelry, this percentage reaches 40%(www.fundivo.com). Moreover, Black Friday has been considered as a unique consumption ritual that blends elements of traditional shopping with holiday rituals (Thomas and Peters, 2011).In anticipation of this day, retailers usually add employees, increase their inventories, prepare new promotions, and change store layouts. Retailers have implemented numerous strategies for drawing customers to the stores. Many stores open their doors at 5 a.m., or earlier, to accommodate eager shoppers; some even remain open all night. \n\nTaken together, these factors combine to create a unique shopping e event that, despite its popularity, has received surprisingly limited research attention. Retailers advertise heavily and promote special sales to attract customers. Many businesses provide incentives, such as ‘door buster’ and ‘early bird’ sales, to motivate consumers to visit their store and to come early (Horovitz 2009). Most large retailers post their Black Friday advertisements, coupons and offers online well in advance, giving shoppers insight about upcoming sales so they can plan their shopping and Black Friday strategies (Katz 2008).On Friday, November 25, 2016  for the first time the Black Friday practice was introduced in Greece. According to the Greek Trade Union (ESEE), retailers responded differently to the event. Thus,1040% of retailers participated in Black Friday depending on the city. Most large chain stores participated by offering sales from 10-40%. Although its g global widespread, there has been a lack of scientific research attention to consumers' attitudes toward and behaviors during Black Friday. \n\nMostly there is a lack of quantitative research on the topic. Most rec recent available studies take a qualitative approach investigating the phenomenon from a ritualistic scope (Bell, Weathers, Hastings and Peterson, 2014; Thomas and Peters, 2011) and to the authors’ knowledge no quantitative study is available that examines the attitudes and the behavior of consumers toward Black Friday, especially when this institution is introduced for the first time in a country. Therefore, the purpose of the study was  to study the behavior, attitudes and intentions of Greek consumers towards Black Friday. Moreover, the objective of this research was to understand differences between shoppers on BlackFriday and non-shoppers and to suggest how retailers can harness these differences in terms of marketing.","url":"https://www.kaggle.com/depekha/black-friday-sales-prediction","version":1,"keywords":["subject, people and society, people, retail and shopping"],"license":{"@type":"CreativeWork","name":"Unknown","url":""},"identifier":["1370943"],"includedInDataCatalog":{"@type":"DataCatalog","name":"Kaggle","url":"https://www.kaggle.com"},"creator":{"@type":"Person","name":"Deepika","url":"https://www.kaggle.com/depekha","image":"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-avatars/thumbnails/3692566-kg.jpg"},"distribution":[{"@type":"DataDownload","requiresSubscription":true,"encodingFormat":"zip","fileFormat":"zip","contentUrl":"https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/depekha/black-friday-sales-prediction/download","contentSize":"7870928 bytes"}],"commentCount":0,"dateModified":"2021-05-27T12:12:50.743Z","discussionUrl":"https://www.kaggle.com/depekha/black-friday-sales-prediction/discussion","alternateName":"","isAccessibleForFree":true,"thumbnailUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-datasets-images/1370943/2276251/a7b849b3813f4585ec9b4a1c5d967ebf/dataset-card.jpg?t=2021-06-08-04-58-43","interactionStatistic":[{"@type":"InteractionCounter","interactionType":"http://schema.org/CommentAction","userInteractionCount":0},{"@type":"InteractionCounter","interactionType":"http://schema.org/DownloadAction","userInteractionCount":112},{"@type":"InteractionCounter","interactionType":"http://schema.org/ViewAction","userInteractionCount":910},{"@type":"InteractionCounter","interactionType":"http://schema.org/LikeAction","userInteractionCount":0}]}</script>
